# About

This dashboard is a prototype which has been made for a talk presented at the [7th Biennial ACSPRI Social Science Methodology Conference](https://conferences.acspri.org.au/2020/).

It explores topic models generated from IMDB review data for the Star Wars prequel movies (Star Wars Episodes I, II and III).
